                        <div class="card-answer">
                            Bone conduction technology allows you to hear audio while still being able to hear surroundings, which is useful when you still want to hear people talking to you, or hear traffic while driving, cycling or walking. It's not meant to be an immersive audio experience in the same way that most headphones are. It's similar to listening to audio from a speaker - you'll hear the audio, as well as what's going on around you. In a quiet room the sound quality is great, but in a loud environment what you hear may be drowned out by surrounding noise. For example, calls or music in an office work well, whereas calls or music in a bar or noisy restaurant will not work.

                            You will have to check with your insurance on this. We are considered as an “Out of Network” provider and insurance policies differ on this issue. If needed, once we ship we are able to provide an itemized breakdown for frames and lens cost if your insurance requires it to consider for coverage.

                            If you need correction for just one field of vision (near or distance), single vision is the way to go. If you need correction for both reading and distance, you likely need progressives. If you don’t need vision correction, you can get the plano (non-corrective) lens. If you’re looking for sunglasses, you can choose between tinted lenses for reducing brightness, or polarized lenses for protection from harsh glares. If you’re looking for transition lenses, you can choose the photochromic adaptive lens option, which are clear indoors and darken under sunlight.

                            We recommend you talk to your optometrist to find the type most suited to you. The lens manufacturer we’re working with provides a range of options as listed above, and we’ll collect your prescription information once the campaign is over.

                        <div class="card-answer">
                            No. Bone conduction transmits sounds directly from your skull to your inner ear, by vibrating the bone above your ear. No one else will be able to hear it, unless you turned the volume extremely high in a quiet room, in which case there would be a bit of sound leakage just like regular earphones. Only you can hear it at normal volumes.
